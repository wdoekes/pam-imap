This is just a simple log of the changes made to this code. 
Changes made by Cal Heldenbrand unless otherwise noted.

As of 0.3.8

-- Created RPM spec file - Richard C. Greenwood
   - Added and cleaned up sample configs

-- Very minor code cleanup - Richard C. Greenwood
   - Fixed some typos (DEUBG -> DEBUG)
   - Allowed install path to be overridden in Makefile

-- Modified check_user app to be a little more intelligent
	- Checks Account info -- even though its not needed
		for pam_imap, it's useful as a debugging tool

As of 0.3.7 

-- Fixed 16 char username limit
  - usernames are defaulted at 64 chars, and can
    be changed easily w/ MAX_USERNAME, also MAX_PASSWORD too
  - Thanks to Tiziano Tresanti for spotting this one!

-- Fixed the "sleep()" problem. 
  - authentications will now be 3 seconds faster  ;-)
  - Uber thanks to Neale Pickett for this!
 
-- Added support for PAM_Domain, adding a username@domain.com
    style login for Micro$oft IMAP servers
  - Thanks to Ankit Rajvansh...  pam_imap is a little more 
    complient with everyone's needs :)

As of 0.3.6
    -- Added hash table password caching.  Very usefull.  :)
    -- fixed a few minor bugs
    -- changed DES encryption to use MD5 encryption

As of 0.3.5
	-- Added "PAM_BlockList" directive =>  Allows a list of users
		that will not be checked against the IMAP server
		(IE:  root, Administrator, apache, whatever)
	-- Fixed the problem if libdb was not found, or
		libndbm, isync.h would give a parse error for DBM
		=>  took out requirement for DBM, so this will not happen anymore

As of 0.3.4
	-- Fixed malloc bug when pam_imap reaches the "end" of
	the available server list and segfaults.
	-- Disallowed NULL passwords to be sent to the IMAP server

As of 0.3.3 -- Fixed the password exchanging for stacking modules
	IE:  Now, you may use pam_unix.so as a first check, then
	use pam_imap.so as a secondary (but required) check


----   Older Crap ------

Added in autoconf scripts -- This is not *fully* implemented, but
	it does do some basic checks and allows the user to set
	DEBUG mode easily

Added functionality for server rollover

Created a configuration file interface, based off of what isync used,
and also added my own parser for extra functionality in the .conf file.
(parseconf.c)

Changed the entire IMAP client interface.  Was using the University
of Washington IMAP library.  I didn't like this library -- found
a package called isync which had a VERY nice implementation.
